The system implements semantics for data creation, deletion, arbitrary read and write in a strict-consistency data model.</p>         <p>As in similar systems, Celeste divides data into fragments and replicates each fragment on multiple nodes in the system. Celeste dynamically caches and re-caches fragment replicas to ensure that a minimum number of them exist in the system to protect against loss and that enough fragments are available to recover the entirety of the data. Celeste clients create, write, and subsequently read data despite the fact that some of the nodes, and consequently some of the fragments, may be unavailable.</p>         <p>In contrast to many other similar systems, Celeste clients are able to update any portion of the data including the ability to delete it. Celeste has a strict data coherency model which is maintained despite multiple simultaneous readers and writers, and arbitrary node failures. Data is deleted completely, even in the face of temporary node failures and absence. Celeste clients work with data using a full complement of operations: create, delete, read, write, and administrative controls such as access control. While Celeste provides a global name-space for all data, the name-space can be divided into sub-domains.</p>         <p>Experimental and example applications for Celeste range from small systems maintaining a high-available central repository of metadata for a large storage system to a general purpose geographically distributed &quot;cloud&quot; storage system comprised of several hundred nodes.</p>         <p>In addition to simply storing and retrieving data, Celeste is also a development platform for writing applications that are distributed across the fragments of the stored data. The distributed components of the application run in parallel producing results that are collated, similar to other contemporary map/reduce systems, or in new ways devised by the application programmer.</p>         <p>Developer applications have access to stored data and are used to extend the data access interface and can derive new data to store. For example, the read interface can be extended to permit an application to read image or video files in different formats performing the translation as the data is read from the system.</p>         <p>Celeste originated as Sun Microsystems Laboratories research project investigating techniques for building large scale, distributed systems that work not only in secured data centers but also in open and potentially hostile environments such as the Internet.</p>         <p>While the system is demonstrable, Celeste is still very much a work-in-progress. Our goal is to expand Celeste into the areas of distributed processing and storage using the foundation developed. We invite other developers, users and researchers to consider Celeste as a platform for their own applications, extensions and further work.</p>         <p> If you are interested in knowing more please contact the owner at <strong>owner@project.dev.java.net</strong>, replacing &quot;project&quot; with &quot;celeste&quot;.</p>      <h3>TITAN</h3>     <p>Titan is a sub-project of the Celeste project and Celeste is an application using the TITAN framework. </p>       <p>Titan implements a peer-to-peer overlay network message routing service. By using distributed hash table (DHT) techniques, this service reliably routes messages among the applications using the service in an environment where the participating components (nodes) are heterogeneous, casually participating, potentially unavailable, and even to some degrees malicious.</p>       <p> In addition to routing messages among the nodes comprising the Titan overlay network, Titan models a pool in which Titan objects (object or objects) exist and are named by unique names. While these objects are fundamentally hosted on, or in some cases bound to, nodes comprising the system (and recursively include the nodes themselves as objects in the pool), Titan abstracts away the details of which node is hosting which object and instead provides interfaces where messages are sent to and from objects solely by their names and not by their location.</p>       <p>A Titan node periodically advertises the availability of objects that it hosts, and the unavailability of objects that it previously hosted but no longer. These advertisements, or publish/unpublish operations, refresh the soft-state maintained by the pool recording which object is currently located on which nodes. From this basic function, any object can be located dynamically using the message routing infrastructure of the DHT overlay network. <br />    From the application programme's perspective, a message is sent to a named object and a response returned. Some objects may be replicated on many nodes in the system in an attempt to ensure availability, and because of the way Titan routes messages, the more replicas of an object that exist in the object pool a message will probabilistically traverse a shorter path to reach the destination object. Thus the more object replicas there are, the more the load is distributed and the better the system performs. <br />    Objects are free to implement their own behaviour corresponding to the messages they receive as well as specifying to the pool how to manage the object's life-cycle, such as the degree of replication in the pool, the time-to-live of an object replica, any caching, and even controlled deletion. Each message received by an object induces some operation by the object and necessarily produces a response message which is returned to the sender of the original message. Example operations are to return some stored data, send messages to other objects, or interface to some external component such as a sensor, actuator, or independent application. In practice, the vast majority of objects are immutable and represent a service (and the vast majority of these have been services that simply encapsulate some stored data), and any single object found in the set of replicas is sufficient to respond to a message. For objects that are not immutable, that is to say messages can modify their persistent state, Titan provides a Byzantine Quorum service for implementing strict consistency mutable objects in the pool. </p>       <p>As alluded to above, objects can represent practically anything. From simple stored data, to applications, services, programming platforms, users and computers a Titan object models the service and is the interface between Titan messages and the effects of these messages on the objects in the pool. <br />    Writing an application that uses Titan consists of a minimum of one or more classes that implement the interface sunlabs.titan.api.TitanService (perhaps using sunlabs.titan.node.services.AbstractTitanService as an aid to implementing the common methods),  and writing a class that instantiates an instance of TitanNode (see sunlabs.titan.node.TitanNodeImpl) and adds the new classes to the running node via sunlabs.titan.api.TitanNode.getService(Class). </p>     <h3>Documentation</h3>     <p> Documentation is maintained collaboratively at the Celeste  <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/Celeste"> wiki</a> and in the Documents &amp; Files link found on the left of this page.</p>     <h3>Participation:</h3>     <p>This project provides opportunities for developers with various kinds of expertise and interests to participate in a wide variety of ways.
