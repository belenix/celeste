This directory contains files pertinent to running Celeste as an SMF
(Service Management Facility) service on Solaris (release 10 or higher)
systems.  If you don't have access to a Solaris (or OpenSolaris)
system, it's safe to ignore this directory.  (But don't remove it; the
ant binary-dist target expects to find this directory and includes its
contents in the distribution it constructs.)

On Solaris systems, you can enable Celeste as an SMF service by:

1)  # svccfg import <base-installation-directory>/svc/sunlabs-celeste.xml

2)  Use svccfg to edit properties of the "standalone" or
    "incremental-node" instance as needed to match local requirements.
    The sunlabs-celeste.xml manifest file contains a description of the
    properties the service uses.  (The "standalone" instance should be
    usable for experimental deployments without requiring any property
    edits.)

    For example, let's suppose that you want to change the gateway that
    the "incremental-node" instance uses.  Use svccfg to change the
    value of the application/gateway property (I've reformatted the
    setprop command line to split it into two lines for readability):

    # svccfg
    svc:> select application/celeste:incremental-node
    svc:/application/celeste:incremental-node> listprop application/*
    application/gateway          astring  celeste.sunlabs.com:12001
    application/number_of_nodes  integer  1
    svc:/application/celeste:incremental-node> setprop application/gateway = \
	myhost.mydomain:12001
    svc:/application/celeste:incremental-node> quit
    #

    (If you have multiple property changes to make, you can gather them
    together into a command file and use svccfg's -f flag to run them
    as a batch.)

    To make the change applied above take effect, use svcadm to refresh
    the service instance:

    # svcadm refresh svc:/application/celeste:incremental-node

    Now you're ready to proceed to step 3 to start the modified Celeste
    service instance running.

3)  # svcadm enable application/celeste:<name of the instance to start>

See svccfg(1M), svcadm(1M), and svcs(1) for more information on
managing SMF services.
