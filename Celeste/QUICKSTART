After successfully building, or untaring a prebuilt system:

From the top-level directory, in a terminal window execute:

./bin/celeste clobber restart

Wait about 30 seconds for the system to settle.

This will start a default configuration consisting of 6 nodes, all running on the local computer.
Log output will be stored in /tmp/celeste-`hostname`.log.

To exercise the system with a small example execute the following command:

./languages/bash/celestesh-example


To use the demo web file-system interface, execute:

./bin/celeste-httpd restart

and then visit http://127.0.0.1:15000 with your web browser.

Login with a name-space name and password combination.  One is created for
you when you login the first time, but is not preserved if you "clobber"
and restart the system later.
