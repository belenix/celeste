<h3>
Extent Management
</h3>
<p>
An extent is half open interval that includes the position denoted by
its start offset and excludes the position denoted by its end offset.
The {@code Extent} interface defines the basic behavior expected of an
extent and the {@code ExtentImpl} class provides a bare bones
implementation.  The interface includes methods for examining extent
bounds, for determining whether an extent is
{@link sunlabs.titan.util.Extent#isVacuous() vacuous},
for determining whether two extents have a non-vacuous intersection, and
for producing that intersection.

</p><p>

The {@code BufferableExtent} interface specializes {@code Extent} to
allow for a buffer to be associated with a given extent.  {@code
ExtentBuffer} implements this interface and acts as a logical extension
to {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer} that allows byte buffers to be treated
as extents.  The class provides versions of all the {@code ByteBuffer}
methods that are adapted to extent buffers and augments the {@code
Extent} methods with ones that produce {@code ExtentBuffer} results
(and that therefore cannot share names with the corresponding {@code
Extent} methods).

</p><p>

Extents can be gathered together into maps, and the package provides
{@code ExtentMap} and {@code ExtentBufferMap} classes that do so for
undifferentiated extents and extent buffers respectively.  In addition
to the normal {@code Map} operations, these classes provide methods to
fetch submaps containing extents overlapping a given extent, to return
a map containing the intersection against a given extent, and so on.

</p>

<h3>
LRUCache
</h3>

The package provides the {@code LRUCache} class and several associated
helper classes for maintaining a LRU cache of keyed objects.
