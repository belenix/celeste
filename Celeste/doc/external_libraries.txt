The lib directory holds external jar files used by the
Celeste project. 

Contents:
classdepandjar.jar      ClassDepAndJar task
junit-4.1-jar            JUnit jar file
findbugs-1.1.3           findbugs lint-like tool

Notes:
ClassDepAndJar comes from the Jini Rio project and can
be downloaded from https://classdepandjar.dev.java.net .
The jar file includes the Jini tool ClassDep, which 
analyzes classes to find other classes on which they
depend.

JUnit jar file comes from junit.org.
Documentation can be found at http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc_40/index.html

Documentation for ClassDepAndJar is scarce; there is
a little bit of info at the URL above.  The Jini javadoc
for com.sun.jini.tool.ClassDep has more information on
ClassDep itself.

Findbugs can be found at http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/
There's documentation for it there, as well as doc for the Ant task.
